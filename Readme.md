#### Whimsical dependency management for unpackaged projects ####

`towels` is a work-in-progress, but can be used if you're willing to find bugs as you go along. It is intended to be used as a way of keeping track things that you need to build your projects; especially projects that aren't packaged through a system that handles dependencies for you. Create a Towels directory in your project, fill it up with YAML files for each towel (dependency), then run `towel` from the parent directory. Done!  

For now, you can see an example in our [Towel Rack repository](http://github.com/o6/Towel-Rack).
